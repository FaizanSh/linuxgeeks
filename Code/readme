This thing is already compiled and to run it ./main Arguments
example ./main strace ls

if you want to compile it again

gcc -c helpingFunctions.c
gcc -c spawnChild.c
gcc -c traceChild.c
gcc -c main.c

gcc main helpingFunctions spawnChild traceChild -o main

			Problem
..............................................................
..............................................................

I am stuck at the point of tracing the childt suppose its happening because my waitpid(-1, &status, __WALL) returns the pid of parents process which has forked the new child until the child gets terminated then I get return pid of the forked child and 9 as &status value)
..............................................................

..............................................................
When I get clone system call, I confirmed the new spawn child via terminal 
ps -p PID -o comm=
After that I get to see 5 more set_robust_list system calls and after fifth call the terminal (after doing ps -p PID(new spawndChild) -o comm=) show the process as <defunct>
After 5th call 
           sRC = ptrace( PTRACE_GETREGS, (pid_t)newpid, 0, &registers);
ptrace returns -1 (no such process error) and I was exiting because of it.

But now when I continue I see the new PID return value and 9 as status value as explained in the 2nd Paragraph

Point to PONDER: During the 5 set_robust_list systemCalls I was only getting pid of   parent process in return to waitpid(-1, &status, __WALL) which means I am getting signals from it not the forked child which I am supposedly tracing.
